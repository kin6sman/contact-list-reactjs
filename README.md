# React Contact List App
The React Contact List App is a web application that allows users to view, create, update, and delete contacts. The app retrieves contact data from a server and provides a user-friendly interface for managing contact information.

## Features
- View Contacts: The app fetches contact data from the server and displays it in a list format. Users can see the contact's name, phone number, and email address.

- Add Contact: Users can add a new contact to the list by providing the contact's name, phone number, and email address. When a new contact is added, it is saved to the server.

- Update Contact: Users can update the details of an existing contact by editing the contact's name, phone number, or email address. The updated contact information is then sent to the server for storage.

- Delete Contact: Users can delete a contact from the list, permanently removing it from the server.
